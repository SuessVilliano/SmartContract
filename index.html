        <h1>Welcome to the Solana Pay Smart Contract Tool</h1>
        <p>
            This tool is designed to enhance e-commerce transactions by leveraging the power of Solana blockchain technology. 
            It operates like a smart contract, enabling you to automate and secure payment processes within your Shopify store.
        </p>

        <h2>Why We Created This Tool</h2>
        <p>
            Managing payments in a traditional e-commerce setup can be complex, especially when handling multiple recipients and ensuring security. 
            We created this tool to simplify these processes, providing an efficient way to split payments, manage funds, and enhance security by integrating cold wallet storage.
        </p>

        <h2>What Is It?</h2>
        <p>
            This tool acts as an intermediary between your Shopify store and the Solana blockchain. When a customer makes a payment using Solana Pay, 
            the tool automatically processes the payment, splits it according to predefined rules, and can transfer funds to secure cold storage.
        </p>

        <h2>How It Works</h2>
        <p>
            The tool works by receiving a webhook notification whenever a payment is made through Solana Pay. It then parses the payment data and 
            distributes the funds to multiple wallets based on the predefined percentages. 
            <span class="highlight">For example, if you have three recipients with a 50%, 30%, and 20% split, the tool will automatically send the corresponding amounts to each wallet.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
            Additionally, you can configure the tool to periodically or manually transfer funds from the escrow wallet to a cold wallet, ensuring maximum security for your assets.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Note:</strong> All transactions are securely handled on the Solana blockchain, ensuring transparency and reliability.
        </p>

        <h2>Getting Started</h2>
        <p>
            To get started, simply configure the tool with your wallets, set the desired payment splits, and integrate it with your Shopify store. 
            The tool will take care of the rest, allowing you to focus on growing your business.
